\begin{enumerate}
	\item Dynamic programming is used to solve optimization problem, by only solving the same problem one time.
	\item Introduce rod cutting problem with exponential asymptotic runtime
	\item Use Dynamic programming if optimization problem exhibit \emph{Optimal substructure} and \emph{overlapping subproblems}. Explain and show on rod-cutting problem.
	\item Explain why the bottom up approach for the rod cutting problem has $O(n^2)$ runtime.
	\item Get into the differences between top-down and bottom-up approaches.
\end{enumerate}
